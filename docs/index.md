# NextCore, in development.

Clean-room macOS boot engineering for standard UEFI systems. Track the latest evidence and what remains before a physical desktop.

## Development progress

Verified steps. Explicit boundaries. A working desktop is the destination.

### 16,384-instruction diagnostic budget reached

The bounded local macOS 27 kernel prefix reached its diagnostic budget after BFM support. No unsupported instruction stopped this run. Budget exhaustion does not establish forward boot progress or normal startup. Physical macOS desktop output remains unverified.

### EFI selection & recovery

Selected child execution and optional presentation failures are exercised in OVMF. Essential failures remain visible and recoverable.

### ARM execution

Instruction coverage advances through explicit native, reference and firmware checks. Original-input progress is reported separately.

### Physical desktop

Sustained kernel execution, userspace and visible desktop output on the target computer still need direct evidence.

### Graphics acceleration

Firmware graphics and host GPU activity do not establish guest Metal support. Acceleration follows visible desktop output.
