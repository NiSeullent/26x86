# Progress you can inspect.

Each milestone has its own acceptance gate. Passing a firmware test does not establish kernel, userspace or physical display success.

**Development channel:** These latest runtime results belong to [PR #19](https://github.com/26x86/26x86/pull/19) and its pinned module branches. Publishing this documentation does not merge that runtime into `main` or release a bootable macOS system. Use the [explicit development checkout](wiki/Nextcore-Modules.md#clone-and-build) to reproduce it.

## Mapped prefix: 42,256,374 instructions; MMFR1 feature-register boundary

r29 completes 6,012,373 data operations and passes MMFR0 before SYSTEM_REGISTER_TRAP (status 13) at MRS ID_AA64MMFR1_EL1. The provider reports no error. The 1280 by 800 framebuffer remains zero with matching GOP readback; normal startup and physical desktop remain unverified.

## Optional table-management controls

The latest correction rejects all 15 nonzero combinations of unsupported HA, HD, HPD0 and HPD1 controls before changing state. Independent checks pass 160 C assertions and two Rust suites of 102 tests each, including preserved register state and warm translation caches. The same test fixture detects the earlier acceptance bug; immutable and dynamic service admission remains unchanged.

This is a bounded unsupported-input policy. It does not implement MMFR1 advertisement, architectural write-ignore behavior or a new original boot run. The r29 MMFR1 boundary and normal `NOT_READY` status remain unchanged.

## New authored hierarchy qualification

The latest increment qualifies hierarchical memory permissions with 961 OVMF EFI cases, 306 Arm QEMU TCG observations and 258 direct service comparisons. Native provider suites pass 34 tests in each of three cache modes, with 104 reference tests and two detected semantic mutants. This does not advance the original-input boundary: r29 remains unchanged at the MMFR1 trap.

The original r6 preservation check failed because an uncompiled Arm host runner changed during collection; separate source auditing qualifies the completed native checks without rewriting that failure. A [fresh public CI replay](https://github.com/26x86/26x86/actions/runs/34713439375) now repeats the complete gate with all source hashes preserved; all six workspace jobs and the separate Sandbox workflow pass.

### EFI picker & child execution

OVMF exercises selection, failure reporting, return to the picker and optional display fallback.

### ARM64 translation

Native execution, reference semantics and authored EFI fixtures constrain each increment. Original-input progress has a separate record.

### Owned guest framebuffer → GOP

An authored guest reads the encoded boot-video fields and writes its reserved framebuffer. Nine checks pass at 1280 by 800 pixels, including exact RGB readback from GOP. A separate run without GOP completes the 64-instruction CPU diagnostic while video reports `NOT_FOUND`; it does not pass video validation.

This connects guest memory to firmware output. Persistent presentation, firmware-exit lifetime, normal startup and a physical macOS desktop remain unverified.

The completed r29 original prefix passes the exact MMFR0 read and reaches an MMFR1 feature-register trap after 42,256,374 instructions. Its screen still matches a zero-filled frame. No kernel-generated visible output has been established.

### Kernel → userspace → display

An ordered boot transcript and direct physical display evidence are required for a successful macOS boot claim.

## What a completed milestone requires

| Milestone | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Firmware behavior | Real UEFI target build and explicit runtime checks |
| Boot framebuffer connection | Guest reads encoded video fields, writes owned storage and matches actual GOP readback |
| Original-input advancement | Replay with final source revision and exact stopping boundary |
| macOS boot | Ordered early boot, XNU and userspace markers from the same run |
| Physical desktop | Direct verification on the identified target computer |
| Graphics acceleration | Guest driver and rendering evidence beyond firmware output |

**Current Status:** Experimental, with distinct verified and unverified layers. **Target State:** Repeatable physical macOS desktop output, then accelerated graphics.
