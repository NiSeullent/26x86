# VSK implementation sources

Policy, message layout, budgets and layer boundaries come from the user-adopted
VF-SPEC-001 v0.1, not from measurements of completed hardware support.

- Intel SDM, edition 092 listed on 2026-09-06:
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html
  VMX allowed-control bit interpretation, ISA and XSTATE definitions. Policy
  helpers consuming captured values are not live MSR probes or VMX enablement.
  Exact VMX control reference: revision 092 volume 3D, appendix A.3, printed
  page A-3 (PDF page 207):

- ACPICA's Intel-maintained `actbl1.h`, DMAR structure definitions:
  https://github.com/acpica/acpica/blob/master/source/include/actbl1.h
  Used to verify DMAR/DRHD/RMRR/device-scope binary offsets; no source copied.
  The parser intentionally rejects unimplemented structures/extensions.
- Intel VT-d architecture specification, section 8.5 (ATSR scope restrictions):
  https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/774206/vt-directed-io-spec%20.pdf
  ATSR device scopes identify PCI sub-hierarchies; endpoint/IOAPIC/HPET scopes
  are rejected in ATSR even though those types occur in other DMAR structures.
- UEFI specification, memory descriptors and Boot Services lifetime:
  https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.11/
  A copied memory map and structurally valid handoff do not establish ownership
  unless the caller obtained buffers through the trusted loader allocator.

The `vf_efi` adapter uses only the UEFI status values and callback signatures
needed for the final-map/`ExitBootServices` boundary. Its unit callbacks are
synthetic; the production EFI entry does not invoke EBS until a post-EBS root
kernel and ownership transfer are available.

These references establish hardware facts, not VSK implementation completion.
First-party code uses the repository license; third-party code or firmware
imports require their own provenance and retained license terms.
